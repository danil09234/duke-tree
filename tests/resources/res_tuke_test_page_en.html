    <h4>Employability</h4>
    <strong>Evaluation of the study programme graduates employability</strong><br/>
    <span style="white-space: pre-wrap">Graduates of bachelor´s studies are aware of the need for further education for their full application in technical practice in positions requiring a second-level university education. Every year, up to 99% of bachelor´s degree graduates express interest in continuing their studies in engineering, while 95% to 100% of them are accepted for this study. From the above, it follows that only 1% to 5% of bachelor´s degree graduates start working. 
The Bachelor´s degree program Applied Electrical Engineering is a continuation of the Bachelor´s degree program Automated Electrical Engineering Systems. The following information on employability is from the portal www.uplatnenie.sk 
Year: 2019 
Source: https://uplatnenie.sk/?degree=V%C5%A0&amp;vs=709000000&amp;faculty=709040000&amp;field=2675R41&amp;year=2019
Number of graduates: 23 
Employed: 4% 
Unemployed : 0% 
Continuing studies: 96% 
Unemployment rate: 0%</span> <br/>

    <strong>Evaluation of the study programme quality by employers</strong><br/>
    <span style="white-space: pre-wrap">On the basis of the presented documents and the knowledge gained during the discussion within the Council of the Applied Electrical Engineering Council, representatives of external parties from practice welcome and support the existence and development of the Applied Electrical Engineering study program, which is also characterized by a certain degree of interdisciplinarity within the field of electrical engineering. In practice, employers primarily prefer engineering degree graduates, due to their broader and interdisciplinary knowledge base. Graduates of the first level of education are aware of the need for further education, therefore 95% to 100% of them continue their studies. 
Employers especially appreciate the broader knowledge of our graduates, who, in addition to electrical engineering, also have knowledge from other fields of study, such as cybernetics (automation, mechatronics, robotics, embedded systems), informatics (artificial intelligence, applied informatics) and mechanical engineering (machine parts and mechanisms , production equipment, transport machinery). The mentioned combination of knowledge with the main focus on electrical engineering is in great demand by employers in the field of industrial automation, where our graduates are most employed. From the point of view of employers, there was, is and will be an interest in applying the graduates of the mentioned study program in practice. There is already a serious lack of qualified experts in this field, which is starting to cause problems with filling vacant positions, especially in the East Slovak region. Employers therefore see a high need for the mentioned study program for practice and guarantee employment for all successful graduates if they are interested in working in the given field.</span> <br/>
